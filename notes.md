- i think "set words", "import words", and "load words",
are quite vague, and i should probabably find a clear way to differentiate between 
the lower level importing words, and the higher level feeding in file path and calling the import functions


okay im gonna go to sleep and hopefully have a better idea of how i want to structure the classes when i wake up

scratch that ive got a pretty banging structure now. what i want to work on is using the property 
decorator to get rid of my getters. ill do that later though. first i need to git init!

might remove the player class cuz i dont actually think i need it (oh wait no cuz input method)
